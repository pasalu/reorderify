# TODO
- Create a separate project stripping out unnecessary addons from sample Spotify project.
- Figure out a way to publish this.
    - Make sure to fork and attribute code to spotify example on github.
- Add the ability to specify which playlist should be reordered.
- Preserve public/private status when compared to original playlist.
- For the dry run, re-use the existing StarredClone since you cannot delete a playlist with the API.
 
# DONE
- Should the user login using their account or can I just retrieve the playlist 
- Create separate new playlists that contain both old and reordered playlist. A dry run option.
- (No option to do this in API) Add a command line level tool to delete a playlist by name.
